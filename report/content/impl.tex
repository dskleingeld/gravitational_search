For \ac{gsa} \cref{eq:G} is used to calculate $G$ at each timestep. With $g_0$ and $\alpha$ paramaters of the search and $N$ the total number of search iterations.
%
\begin{align} \label{eq:G}
	G_i = g_0 \cdot e^{- \alpha * i/N}
\end{align}
%
The number of particles that still attract other particles ($k$ in \cref{eq:grav}) drops as in \cref{eq:k}, Here $P$ is the number of particles, $N$ the number of search steps and $i$ the current step, starting at $1$.
%
\begin{align} \label{eq:k}
	k_i = P - \frac{P}{i/N} + 1
\end{align}
%
As cooling function for \ac{gabsa} we used simple linear cooling starting at temperature $T_0$ and cooling to $0$ see \cref{eq:cooling}.

\begin{align} \label{eq:cooling}
	t_i = T_0 \cdot \frac{N - i + 1}{N}
\end{align}

\subsection{Code}
I chose to write the implementation of \ac{gsa} from scratch in \textit{Rust}\footnote{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust\_(programming\_language)}. Rust was chosen as I am interested in seeing how suitable Rust is for such work, additionally the performance is welcome during testing. The result is a \ac{gsa} object keeping track of the problem and search parameters and optional methods to set a seed for the random generator, chose weather to use annealing (\ac{gabsa} ) and finally to search with or without gathering statistics.

To create a \ac{gsa} object we need:
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item $g_0$ and $\alpha$
\item the maximum number of search steps $N$
\item the evaluation function that takes an array of input values and returns a single number
\item the end criterion, a function that given the current iteration and best solution decides if the seach should continue
\end{enumerate}
%
To start a search call either \textit{search} with the search range and population size to use or call \textit{seach\_w\_stats} with an additional \textit{stats} argument that implements the \textit{Stats} trait. One such object that is provided is \textit{TrackFitness}, it keeps track of the average and best fitness during the search.
