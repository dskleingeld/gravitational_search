Here I will present my GSA implementation compared to the original GSA\cite{GSA} paper for the test functions $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ presented in that paper. Then I will compare my GABSA implementation to its paper\cite{GABSA} for the functions $f_{1}$, $f_{2}$ and $f_{3}$ presented there. And finally I will show my GSA and GABSA implementation compared for $f_{1_{gsa}}$, $f_{2_{gsa}}$ and $f_{_{3_{gabsa}}}$.
